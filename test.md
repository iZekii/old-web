# Test heading
Is it really this easy to make websites with github, using only stuff from this [cheatsheet](http://packetlife.net/media/library/16/Markdown.pdf)?

I thought it would be a little bit harder...

***

## Lets try coding something
So it says on the cheatsheet that you write code just by indenting the words?
```python
from random import randint
  
if randint(0, 10) > 5:
  print('huh')
else:
  print('no')
```
So that should be code *apparently*

### So what about inline code you ask
Well apparently, it's quite the same as before

Use `print('Hello, World!)` to make sure your python is installed correctly

* * *

## Blockquotes?
So it seems that that went well but what about blockquotes?

## Lists
Another thing that I wanted to try out
### Un-ordered
* Apple
* Banana
* Grape
  * Red seedless
  * [Green](#)

### Ordered
1. Python
    1. Pygame
    2. Pyglet
        1. OpenGL
2. Javascript
3. OpenGL

* * *

## Task lists???
I don't think these will work...
- [x] Setup website
- [ ] /(optional) fix grammar
- [ ] Finish this test file

* * *

## Emoji?
:bomb:?

* * *

## And Images
These should work, surely?

## The End?
You've made it to the end of the test doc. If you found this then thumbs up to you :+1:
